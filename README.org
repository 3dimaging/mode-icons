#+STARTUP: showall

* Mode-icons

  Show icons instead of mode names in emacs.

  Modes that have icons instead of names now:

  - Emacs-Lisp
  - Python
  - Scheme
  - Lisp
  - PHP
  - HTML

** Installation

   To install use either method:

*** package.el

    If you have [[http://gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] 24 or ~package.el~ installed manually you can just
    create the tar file and use =package-install-file= to install it.

**** Create the tar file

     Use =make dist= to create the tar file needed for ~package.el~.

*** manually

    Place ~mode-icons.el~ somewhere in your =load-path= and copy the
    ~icons/~ directory there as well. Then =require= ~mode-icons~ in your
    [[http://gnu.org/software/emacs][Emacs]] init file.
